            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Alyssa Frederick and I just graduated from my dream school, Stanford. 
                <br> I've always loved the creative space as I grew up dancing, crocheting, and painting but something about programming also tugged at me. Figuring out code is like a puzzle where there isn't just one correct answer. And above all, the Disney nerd in me was captivated by how coding turns text into physical magic.
                <br> Coming to Stanford, I was set on majoring in CS or ME, but was reluctant to let my creative endeavors go. When I discovered Product Design I realized that the parts I loved most about engineering lay there in tenfold and I was instantly hooked.
                <br> During my time at Stanford, I was one of the presidents of Stanford Women in Design and worked on ways for our growing group to be more connected and homey. I was also heavily involved in the dance community as I have been director of my two teams as well as being a 22-23 Stanford Dollie. #GoCard
                <br> I long for tight connections and believe in the strength of unity. Thus, my dream is to incorporate my deep love of movement to immerse and captivate others in experiences like no other.
