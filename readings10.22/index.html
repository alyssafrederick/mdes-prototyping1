        <h2>Programming Design Systems: Intro</h3>
            <h3>"Even in web design where the page metaphor is still prevalent, it seems limiting to define the design 
                to just the styles of the page."
            </h3>
                <p>What a beautifully concise line! I think so much of design is how the content is delivered, whether 
                    that be by streamlining the actual text, deciding to include imagery, or how other pages flow to and 
                    from the given page.
                </p>
            <h3>"What happens when we try to redefine the graphic design curriculum using a programming language as 
                the tool for the designer?"
            </h3>
                <p>As someone who got into coding first and didn't know about, much less think about, design until 
                    much later, I feel like this question embodies how I looked at design in the beginning. I was 
                    always looking at how things in design processes could be more efficient or optimized so that 
                    designers could focus even more on that deep creative work we want to be doing.
                </p>
            <h3>"Throwing a design over the wall for production is a bad legacy of the printed page, and there is no 
                reason for the design process to end with the birth of a product."
            </h3>
                <p>I've never thought about the design process ending with the birth of a product, but sometimes 
                    I still feel like a design is being "thrown over the wall for production" when you handoff to 
                    engineers at some companies. I wonder how we can get design through every part of the process 
                    more as it is an ongoing conversation we need to be having in order to create products, services, 
                    and systems that are best for users.
                </p>

        <h2>What do Prototypes Prototype</h2>
            <h3>"If the artifact is to provide new functionality for users- and thus play a new role in their 
                lives- the most important questions may concern exactly what that role should be and what 
                features are needed to support it. If the role is well understood, but the goal of the 
                artifact is to present its functionality in a novel way, then prototyping must focus on 
                how the artifact will look and feel. If the artifact's functionality is to be based on a new 
                technique, questions of how to implement the design may be the focus of prototyping efforts."</h3>
                <p>This is a paragraph right on the first page of the article and I think it is the most 
                    thought provoking. Thinking through how a prototype positions itself and what you want to 
                    get out of the prototype is so important and this section makes it clear how you can get the 
                    most out of every prototype. This is definitely a quote I will come back and look at as I 
                    test prototypes to be sure I am on the right path.
                </p>
            <h3>"Finally, prototypes are not self-explanatory: looks can be deceiving."</h3>
                <p>I agree in that I think this is such a key part about prototyping! Briefly telling your 
                    prototype testers what part of the prototype you are considering when they test. And also 
                    being sure to tell them that you are not testing them at all!
                </p>
            <h3>"We consider this storyboard to be a prototype because it makes a concrete representation 
                of a design idea and serves the purpose of asking and answering design questions."</h3>
                <p>I think this sentence really highlights what the examples are here to show us: that 
                    a prototype is good if it answers the question you are asking with it. Sometimes we may 
                    need multiple types of prototypes to answers our questions and sometimes one prototype 
                    can answer a few of our questions.
                </p>
