    <h2>natural forces</h2>
    <p>As probably seen through the last assignment, I really like the ability to place and color these particles on screen.
        So building off of last week a bit, I added in the gravity and thus bouncing aspect of these particles. Additionally I 
        made sure that when you place a particle, the origial direction of it goes up so we can see the drama of the fall. 
    </p>

        I played with the gravity vector, just testing random numbers until I liked how it affected the particles. I wanted it 
        to look mostly like actual gravity but be a bit dramatized so I settled on gravity = createVector(0, 0.002). This allows 
        the particles to bounce more times than you would expect in real life but still eventually calm down. I also like how this 
        number allows the particles to roll around on the floor a bit after they stop bouncing too.
